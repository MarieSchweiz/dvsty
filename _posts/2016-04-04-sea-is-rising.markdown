When i read a scientific study about how art in medical facilities can improve a patients experience i wasn't surprised. Before i drew my first line on this incredibly big canvas i spend almost 6 month figuring out what i like to do. I knew it had to be something i like to watch for a very long time.

## Requirements

* It had to be 2x3 meters. In order to give my studio the athmosphere i wanted.
* it had to be energetic, empower me.
* it had to be nature, something i consider positive
* it could not be cheesy, my nature is dark
* It shouldn't annoy me

## Research

My work is giving me the opportunity to do research in the whole world. I drew while i was traveling through Denmark. I visited the Oceaneum Stralsund and i had the chance to see William Turners art.
