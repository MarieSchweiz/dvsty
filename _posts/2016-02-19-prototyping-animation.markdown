The [UXwell education program](http://uxwell.cz/) is jumping around Praha and delivering "userexperience design" education to their attendees. I was hired to give a lecture on how to prototype animations and discover meaning for a product.

My theory "everyone can animate" is based on the fact, everyone can think in key's and use stickynotes. There is a myth animation is expensive and hard to do. In my opinion it isn't hard to do and in addition it is incredibly useful to place a brand, deliver userexperience and simplify your concept or idea.

### Part 1: Structure your concept.

Storyboards are incredibly useful and its no surprise they are perfect for what we like to archive. I teached how to structure your thoughts and create a hirachy with storyboards.

### Part 2: Everyone can draw, don't be shy.

Storyboards aren't just journeys, they can carry literally any information and one of them is movement.


### Part 3: From A to B.

So animation goes through all layers of hirachy. It can deliver information from our service design, userexperience design and get a user from A to B in our usecase. To support our users we can make an animation and capture our thoughts with postits. My Workshop is teaching how.
