On Saturday September 5th I was hosting a creative iPad workshop at the Academy for new Illustration and design in Berlin. I’m very exited this idea of mine  happened because i believe in touch technology.

Adonit is a well known manufacturer for iPad stylus hardware and one of my clients. Together with the Academy for new Illustration we invited Berlin’s creatives and tablet enthusiasts for a chat and beer.

The workshop was covering a few illustration basics and tricks so everyone was able to join and learn more. Length: 40 minutes.

### Responsive landing page design and development.
Although i am not a front-end developer, i wrote a js free and full responsive landingpage with HTML, CSS / Flex and a few animations.

During the evening we had two workshops, each lasting approx. one hour. Marie´s concept of the workshops was suitable for beginners and experts in illustration and digital drawing. Participants could use one of our rental iPads, bring their own digital device and got a Jot Touch with Pixelpoint from adonit to use during the evening. The illustrations were mainly made with “procreate” for iPad, but some other apps were mentioned during the workshop. Starting with an empty paper, the participants learned using the software, illustration and professional lightning techniques and got plenty of tips using an iPad together with a stylus and drawing app. Spectators also were welcome to join the many discussions about digital creative technics while enjoying some drinks and snacks.

>“Der Workshop war sehr inspirierend! Marie hat es geschafft, mir in kürzester Zeit einen super Einblick zu vermitteln, welche tollen zeichnerischen Möglichkeiten mir, als langjährige Illustratorin, das ipad mit passender Software und einem Zeichenstift bietet.
Ich werde das ipad in Zukunft sicherlich verstärkt beim Skizzieren unterwegs nutzen.
Danke für den tollen Workshop!”
